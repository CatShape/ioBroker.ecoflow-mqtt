## ecoflow-mqtt adapter for ioBroker

connects to ecoflow products

## WARNING

This adapter uses a non-offical communication with the devices. 
Wrong communication or setting wrong values can affect the functionality of the device.


The adapter is based on the work of:
* my own evaluation and research
* https://github.com/tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud
* https://haus-automatisierung.com/hardware/2023/02/13/ecoflow-river-2-usv-batteriespeicher.html
* https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/66743/ecoflow-connector-script-zur-dynamischen-leistungsanpassung
* https://konkludenz.de/en/making-ecoflow-wave2-smart-home-capable-with-node-red-and-mqtt


## Installation and Configuration

Install the adapter from github.

![some mor details](doc/en/installation.md)

In Admin Page (first tab) the mqqt credentials for the mqqt Broker need to be inserted.
* UserName - something like "app-...."
* UserID - a 19 digit number
* UserPassword - an alphanumeric
* ClientID - a string starting with "ANDROID_...."

There are 3 possibilities:
1. by script https://github.com/mmiller7/ecoflow-withoutflow/blob/main/cloud-mqtt/ecoflow_get_mqtt_login.sh
2. by website https://energychain.github.io/site_ecoflow_mqtt_credentials/
3. by adapters own alogorithm (pressing the button), for this the ecoflow username and password is necessary.

The mqqt Broker settings are default and usually need no modification.

Use the second tab "Device(s) Configuration" for adding your equipment.

Parametrizing the Powerstream:
* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Powerstream as shown in the app, something like "HW51...."
* give it a name
* select the version (600W or 800W)

Parametrizing the Powerstation:
* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Powerstation as shown in the app, string varies by type of device
* give it a name
* select the device type
* if additional battery pack is connected, check the port number where it is connected

Parametrizing the Smart Plug:
* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Smart Plug as shown in the app, something like "HW52...."
* give it a name
* set the type to "plug"

Use the third tab "Wave / Glacier Configuration" for adding your equipment.

Parametrizing the Wave :
* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Smart Plug as shown in the app, something like "KT21ZCH..."
* give it a name
* set the type to "plug"

Parametrizing the Glacier:
* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Smart Plug as shown in the app, something like "BX11ZCB..."
* give it a name
* set the type to "plug"

## data point update

If settings to a data point are changed in the new version of adapter (e.g. name, unit, max value) the change is not effective until you:
- stop the adapter instance
- delete the respective datapoint or the whole object structure of the adapter instance
- start the adapter instance

During startup the datapoints are created, but not changed when existing.
